# hass-scriptableWidget-power
*By the example of: [home-assistant-sensor-widget-scriptable](https://github.com/olahellgren/home-assistant-sensor-widget-scriptable/tree/main)*

A widget for the Scriptable app on your iPhone  if you want to monitor a sensor with the name:
sensor.total_power

In my case this sensor has the current power usage of my house.
